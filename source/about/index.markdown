Hey, I'm Thomas,  a French software engineer, working for an awesome company
called [JobTeaser](http://www.jobteaser.com).

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/tlarrieu) and
[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-larrieu-1b8aa835/).

I’m a Terminal-fan, Vim-addict kind of guy. I’m also a keyboard enthusiast and use
Bépo (a French Dvorak-like variant) as my every day keyboard layout.

The purpose of this blog is to share what I believe is interesting content, be
it a Ruby-jedi-trick or a cool app that I can't live without.

Since English is not my mother tongue, I might happen to make some grammar /
spelling mistakes. Deal with it <small>(or leave me a comment somewhere, I'd be glad to
correct it)</small>.
