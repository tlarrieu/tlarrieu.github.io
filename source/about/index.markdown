Hey, I'm Thomas,  a French Ruby developer, working for an awesome company called
[Shopmium](http://www.shopmium.org).

You can find me on [Github](http://github.com/tlarrieu).

I’m a Tmux-fan, Vim-addict kind of guy. I’m also a keyboard enthusiast and use
Bépo (a French Dvorak-like variant) as my every day keyboard layout.

The purpose of this blog is to share what I believe is interesting content, be
it a Ruby-jedi-trick or a cool app that I can't live without.

Since English is not my mother tongue, I might happen to make some grammar /
spelling mistakes. Deal with it (or let me a note somewhere, I'd be glad to
correct it).
