In a recent [article](/blog/2014/01/18/the-proper-tools-to-get-things-done), I
was talking about tools.  In this one, I will be speaking about sharpening them.

Recently, I was made aware of something terrible : my workflow is *clunky*. Or
should I say, not optimized. I often find myself repeating the same operations
throughout the day, involving lots of keystrokes. And up until now, I did not
make a big fuss about it.

Of course, I regularly spent time — and I still do, tailoring my vimrc. Of course
I have a few aliases in my shell configuration. But I somewhat discovered that I
was not so much aggressive about diminishing the number of keystrokes. A few
days ago, I stumbled upon this
[podcast](http://rubyrogues.com/129-rr-sharpening-tools-with-ben-orenstein/).
And it changed my whole vision about the situation. I already had the opportunity
to listen to [Ben](https://github.com/r00k) talking about this alongside his talks.
But this did not struck me much, God knows why.

I have aquired the certitude that small things matters. From this day on, I took
one simple resolution : *improve my workflow*. Little by little, smoothen and
take good care of it.

In practice, here is what I do : everytime I notice something wrong about what
I am doing, something that makes me feel I could do it quicker, I either fix it
immediately, taking around ten minutes to do so, or write it on my
“build-an-awesome-workflow-todo-list”. Every morning, I spend ten to twenty
minutes to remove as much as I can from this list, prior to the morning stand-up,
right before starting to work.

This has two great impacts on my day : first and foremost, it improves my
productivity — well, this was kind of intended! — making me more efficient. But
it has another effect : I start my day on a positive note, no matter what the
day before was made of. I could have spent an horrible day trying to fix a bug
that I quiet did not manage to catch yet, and still start the day on the right 
foot.
