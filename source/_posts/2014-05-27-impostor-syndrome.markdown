Frow [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) :

> The impostor syndrome, sometimes called impostor phenomenon or fraud syndrome,
> is a psychological phenomenon in which people are unable to **internalize
> their accomplishments**. Despite external **evidence of their competence**,
> those with the syndrome remain convinced that they are frauds and do not
> deserve the success they have achieved. Proof of success is dismissed as luck,
> timing, or as a result of deceiving others into thinking they are more
> intelligent and competent than they believe themselves to be.

In today's article, I want to talk about a phenomenon that I've been recently
made aware of.

<!-- more -->

I've been working for eight months straight here at [Shopmium](www.shopmium.com).
And I have to say, everything has been going pretty smoothly : I've become
somewhat competent with both Rails and the business the company is involved in.
I've even been entitled with more responsabilities. I review code and get
asked questions on a daily basis.

But for some reason, up until a month or two, I've been feeling kind of awkward.
God knows why, I kept telling myself that I was not doing a good job. Making
some mistakes sure did not help.

In fact, that's this [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_Vqp1dPuPo) talk
that made me realize why. Our brain seems to focus more on failures than on
successes. No matter what we accomplish, it manages somehow to give us plenty of
reasons to feel bad about what we do. The one great lesson I learned upon
viewing this talk is that no matter what, we have to :

  1. Embrace failure. It happens to everyone. You might even learns things from it.
  2. Look on the bright side. At the end of the day, you are not the complete fraud
  your brains keeps trying to make you think you are.

That, of course, does not mean you should not care about what you are doing. Feeling
bad for doing mistakes is still right.

Just stop bashing your head against the walls !
